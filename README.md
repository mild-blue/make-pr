# Make-pr

if you want to start working on an issue run this script in the project based on the brach you want to make the 
PR into. The script creates new brach, creates a PR for given issue and checkouts this new branch for you.


you need to install and setup gh cli to make this work. Should be easy: https://github.com/cli/cli
